Currently, pet owners lack a proper application that provides functionalities such as instant appointment booking, vet clinic searching, and a way to store and view their pets’ medical records in one platform. Additionally, they also lack the means to quickly provide vet practices with the appropriate medical records for veterinarians to make informed decisions during the appointment.

With the proposed mobile application, pet owners can effortlessly manage and access their pets' medical information and electronic medical records (EMR) through a single application. The integration of both platforms eliminates the need for pet owners to navigate multiple sources, providing a centralized and user-friendly solution for organizing and viewing their pets’ medical records and information.
